				<H3>Why does <I class="CodeWorker">CodeWorker</I> have been developed?</H3>

				The adventure of <I class="CodeWorker">CodeWorker</I> started in 1996, with
				the wish of avoiding typing some repeatitive and tedious programming tasks.
				It is better to focus the skills of a developer on modeling and implementing
				code once, rather than writing kilometers of code lines.
				<P/>
				How to reach these points, to grant these wishes? Not by proposing a new
				method that doesn't offer something concrete, but just reassures the staff
				and puts back the problem further. So, you'll never heard me to tell you:
				<I>"It concerns the development's team, we don't care about the final
				implementation tasks, except that you must conform to the method 'XXX' and
				all will be OK! Now, give me money!"</I>. But I can do it, if you insist.
				<BR />
				So, not a method to propose, but a software that does the work properly. The
				first step is to allow acquiring data (UML, source code, personal description...),
				stored in any kind of text files (Rational ROSE, JAVA, HTML, DTD, personal
				format...). The second step is to organize the interesting parsed information
				into structured types, which hold the role of a parse tree. The third step
				is to generate code (any kind of text) or to transform existing files,
				according to the <I>parsed data</I>.

				<H3>Why use an adapted language for doing the job?</H3>

				At the beginning, the intention wasn't to implement a new language, but to
				extend a generalist language with specific components for parsing text and
				generating code. The library was written in C++, and offered some convenient
				functions for reading tokens and for extracting protected areas from a file,
				for example.
				<BR />
				However, text to generate was written in the syntax of C++, using stream
				operators (once the pattern to generate code has been written, it is too hard
				to move or change some parts), and data structures were declared in	C++,
				heavy to manipulate (quite verbose to iterate a list in C++, not flexibility
				enough to change structures if some attributes or associations have to be
				added or moved or changed, ...).
				<P/>
				This approach was acceptable on projects where the data to extract weren't
				too complex, and were the source code generation was quite simple. But it is unusable
				on big source code generation projects and hard on complex data structures.
				<BR />
				If you share the same experience, you know that it is just sufficient to
				convince you that a fascinating world may be tackling with source code generation,
				but that the syntax of a generalist language doesn't allow to do more than
				touching upon this world.
				<P/>
				So, a new language had to be implemented, mainly (at this time) to make
				easier the source code generation in a way that is very common today: by inlaying
				the scripting language to interpret into the text to write. This is exploited
				for instance by:
				<UL>
					<LI>the <I>JSP (Java Server Pages)</I>, where the Java code is embedded
						between the tags <B>'&lt;%'</B> and <B>'%&gt;'</B>,</LI>
					<LI>the HTML pages, where PHP is embedded between the tags <B>'&lt;?'</B>
						and <B>'?&gt;'</B>,</LI>
					<LI>the HTML pages again, where the Java Script (for example) is embedded
						between the tags <B>'&lt;SCRIPT'</B> and <B>'/SCRIPT&gt;'</B>,</LI>
				</UL>

				<H3>Why not to exploit an existing scripting language?</H3>

				This new language was an interpreted scripting language, where parsing, data
				representation and source code generation could be developed and manipulated in
				an homogeneous way (all in the same language), and where the syntax could be
				adapted to facilitate as well source code generation than parsing or data handling.
				And now, we dispose of:
				<UL>
					<LI>the tag <B>'@'</B> that allows swapping between text generation and
						interpretation of scripts, but it accepts the tags <B>'&lt;%'</B> and
						<B>'%&gt;'</B> too,</LI>
					<LI>all interesting functions to read tokens an to ignore blanks or
						comments,</LI>
					<LI>writing a parsing script like a BNF (more convenient than reading
						tokens) that allows changing the syntax independently of the parsing
						representation,</LI>
					<LI>structured data as trees, which are populated in a very	natural
						way</LI>
					<LI>a syntax looking like the one of a classical procedural language,
						such as C++ or PASCAL (declaration of functions, iteration of lists,
						try/catch management, ...), so not arduous at all,</LI>
					<LI>an integrated debugger,</LI>
					<LI>a profiling tool that measures the coverage of scripts and the time
						consuming,</LI>
					<LI>...</LI>
				</UL>
				Thanks to this approach, <!-- and as detailed into paragraph
				<A href="Maturation.html">maturation</A>,--> it has appeared that:
				<UL>
					<LI><I>pattern scripts</I> (means dedicated to source code generation) were
						reflecting the skills of developers and that these skills were
						<B>really</B> reusable,</LI>
					<LI>the more concepts the developer will put into the modeling, the more
						reactive he will become and the more architectural solutions or
						application designs he will be able to validate,</LI>
					<LI>a good formal language for modeling allows never typing twice the
						same code, but implementing a lot of code automatically , if it is
						coupled to smart scripts for source code generation (remember: the skills of
						developers, it capitalizes the IT knowledge),</LI>
